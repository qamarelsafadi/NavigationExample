# Compose Navigation Central Park 🌳🎢


Welcome to Compose Navigation Central Park, where navigating through your app feels like a walk in the park! 🚶‍♂️🚀

## What is this?

This repository showcases how to centralize your Jetpack Compose navigation in one convenient location. Imagine it as the GPS for your app's rollercoaster ride—smooth, efficient, and always guiding your users to their destinations without any detours. 🎢

## Why Central Park?

In this metaphorical park, our main attraction is a single file that holds all the navigation logic. No more getting lost in a maze of composables! Just like how Central Park is a green oasis in the heart of New York City, this repo is your oasis for streamlined navigation in your Android app. 🌳🏙️

## Each Scope, Its Own Central Park

Just like each neighborhood in a city needs its own park, each scope or feature in your app should have its own dedicated "Central Park" for navigation. This keeps things organized, scalable, and ensures that each part of your app operates smoothly and independently.
